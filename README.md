NewsIndexer
===========

NewsIndexer project was the project 1 of the CSE-535 course (Information Retrieval)
that was taught in Fall 2014.

The starter code and tests for this project can be obtained from the github handle: nicklondhe. The provision of the starter code and test by Nikhil Londhe hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the code. It is to be assumed that the base code was provided by him who was then the Teaching Assistant for the course.
